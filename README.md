Introduction:

Our project focuses on the visualization of cricket data to derive meaningful insights. To achieve this, we have identified two primary data sources: ESPN Cricinfo StatsLinks to an external site. and CricsheetLinks to an external site.. Additionally, we will be utilizing the "cricketdata" R packageLinks to an external site. to parse and analyze the data efficiently.

Data Sources:

ESPN Cricinfo Stats:
ESPN Cricinfo is a renowned cricket-related website that provides comprehensive statistics covering a wide range of cricket matches. The data available on this platform spans across various formats, including Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). The statistics encompass player performance, team records, match results, and other relevant cricket metrics. This source is invaluable for obtaining detailed and up-to-date cricket-related information.
Cricsheet:
Cricsheet is a platform that offers cricket data in a structured and machine-readable format. It provides ball-by-ball data for a vast array of cricket matches, making it a valuable resource for detailed match analysis. The downloadable datasets from Cricsheet cover a wide range of matches, including international and domestic fixtures. The availability of granular data, such as individual deliveries and player actions, enhances the depth of analysis and visualization possibilities.
Data Parsing and Analysis:

cricketdata R Package:
 We have chosen the "cricketdata" R package as our primary tool for parsing and processing data from ESPN Cricinfo and Cricsheet. This package streamlines the data retrieval process, enabling us to focus on deriving insights rather than dealing with intricacies of data extraction. The "cricketdata" package efficiently converts the data from ESPN Cricinfo into a format suitable for analysis. Its compatibility with Cricsheet data ensures a seamless integration of both sources, providing a consolidated dataset for visualization purposes.
Conclusion:

In conclusion, our project relies on the rich cricket data available from ESPN Cricinfo and Cricsheet, complemented by the streamlined data parsing capabilities of the "cricketdata" R package. This combination of reputable sources and efficient analysis tools forms the foundation for our cricket data visualization project, promising in-depth insights into player and team performance across various formats.
