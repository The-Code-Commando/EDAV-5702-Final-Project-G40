The missing values here simply denote the performance of players who have played too less for the statistics to even be generated. Many rows in this dataset correspond to bowlers, who do not get to score runs (often do not get to play), and hence they have very less records to generate summary statistics.\n\n\nCode\ngg_miss_upset(df)\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis is an Upset plot representing the missing values in the dataframe containing the seasonal performance of players. This kind of plot is very useful in understanding the interaction of missing values between columns. The Batting Average column contains over 2000 missing values, while the other columns 50s, 100s, Duck Outs and Strike Rates have just below 1000 missing values, whereas 805 missing values across the intersection of all these columns. The vertical bars denote the cardinality of the missing values based on each intersection of the columns. There are 1110 rows where only the Batting average values are missing, whereas . Rows where 100s, 50s 0s and Strike Rates have missing values, most likely correspond to players who have played very fey games, and their Batting averages have also not been generated. Hence, there is very strong interaction amongst the occurence of missing values across these values.\n\n\n2.4.2 Analysis 2\n\n\nCode\np1 &lt;- DataExplorer::plot_missing(icc_2011)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\np2 &lt;- DataExplorer::plot_missing(icc_2015)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\np3 &lt;- DataExplorer::plot_missing(icc_2019)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\np4 &lt;- DataExplorer::plot_missing(icc_2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe can observe from the plots above, that the pattern of percentage of missing values is similar, across the different world cup finals from 2011 to 2023.\nThis is because the missing values occur in columns such as player_dismissed, legbyes, noballs, wides etc. These events seldom occur throughout the game. The dismissal of a player can occur at most 20 times in an entire match, which corresponds to maximum 20 rows in our dataset.\nExtras are also fairly limited in a game since extras are a reflection of mistake made by a player.\n\n\n2.4.3 Analysis 3\n\n\nCode\nmissmap(icc_2011, main=\"Missing Data Map - 2011 ICC WC Finals\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmissmap(icc_2019, main=\"Missing Data Map - 2019 ICC WC Finals\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information we gain is that we get to know at what stages of the game the players were dismissed, or extras occurred, and we also get to know the proportion of total missing values."

The discernible trend reveals a consistent augmentation in the average runs per match over this period.\nNotably, the data portrays a marked rise in scoring rates, with the average score per match escalating from approximately 200 runs in 1971 to surpassing 300 runs by the year 2023. This substantial increase prompts an examination of contributing factors within the realm of cricket dynamics.\nOne pivotal influence on the heightened scoring trend is attributed to advancements in batting techniques and equipment. The contemporary cricketer, wielding modernized bats, demonstrates an enhanced ability to strike the ball with greater force and distance. Furthermore, alterations in playing conditions, particularly smaller and swifter outfields, have facilitated an environment conducive to frequent boundary scoring.\nA significant paradigm shift in bowling strategies is also discernible. Historically characterised by a focus on tight line and length, bowlers in recent years have embraced a more aggressive approach, directing their efforts towards attacking the batsmen by targeting the stumps. This strategic shift has resulted in an increased frequency of high-scoring encounters.\nThe implications of this burgeoning scoring trend have elicited diverse reactions among cricket enthusiasts. While some revel in the heightened excitement afforded by high-scoring matches, others lament the potential dilution of traditional batting and bowling skills. The evolving dynamics of international cricket, as depicted by this data, underscore the multifaceted interplay between technological advancements, strategic innovations, and the nuanced preferences of cricket aficionados."

It’s important to note that a lofty total runs tally doesn’t necessarily guarantee a formidable batting average. There are several factors contributing to this:\nNot Outs: Batsmen who consistently conclude innings without being dismissed may not boast an impressive total runs figure, yet they can possess a commendable batting average. This is because a higher frequency of not outs diminishes the denominator, resulting in an elevated batting average.\nInconsistency: Players who experience sporadic bursts of exceptional scoring but falter with low scores in other innings may accumulate a substantial total run count without a correspondingly high average. The key lies in sustained performance and avoiding erratic dips, as consistency plays a pivotal role in maintaining an impressive batting average.\nStrike Rates: Batting strike rate (s/r) is defined for a batter as the average number of runs scored per 100 balls faced. The higher the strike rate, the more effective a batter is at scoring quickly.\nExamining the provided chart, it becomes evident that there is a discernible negative correlation between the Average Strike Rate and the Batting Average. While this correlation isn’t a universal law, it can be observed in specific scenarios:\nAggressive Batting Style: Batsmen who adopt an aggressive approach, taking calculated risks and aiming for quick scoring, often exhibit a higher strike rate paired with a lower batting average. The frequency of dismissals tends to be higher due to the inherent risks taken during play. However, when successful, these players score rapidly, contributing to an elevated strike rate.\nSafe Batting Style: Conversely, batsmen employing a more defensive strategy may showcase a higher batting average coupled with a lower strike rate. By prioritising longevity at the crease, these players minimise risks, resulting in fewer dismissals. Although their scoring rate may be comparatively lower, the reduced frequency of dismissals contributes to a superior batting average."

The opening duo of Tharanga and Dilshan took the field, but unfortunately, Tharanga faced an early dismissal, as indicated by the concise bar corresponding to him in the early stages of the game. The standout highlight of the first innings was Mahela Jayawardene’s stellar century, with the majority of his runs proving crucial in the decisive death overs. Notably, Sangakkara, the Sri Lankan captain, made a significant contribution during the middle overs, observable in the colour variations in the bar corresponding to his innings.\nExamining the first plot, it is evident that Sri Lanka scored fewer runs during the powerplay overs compared to India, despite losing only one wicket. The disparity in the bar heights for the last 10 overs reflects India’s consistent superiority in scoring throughout the game, enabling them to successfully chase down the target in under 50 overs.\nTransitioning to the second innings, India faced an early setback with the departures of Virender Sehwag and the legendary Sachin Tendulkar within the first 10 overs. However, Gautam Gambhir showcased remarkable resilience, occupying the crease for an extended period and accumulating an impressive number of runs, as depicted in the plots. The Indian Captain, MS Dhoni, played a pivotal role with a stellar performance, particularly dominating in the later stages of the innings and guiding India to a triumphant victory. Yuvraj Singh’s valuable contribution in the final 10 overs also played a crucial role in securing India’s success.\n\n\n3.3.3 ICC 2015 World Cup (Men’s) Final\n\n\nCode\ndf_2015_p1 %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(innings) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=binned_overs, y=runs, fill=factor(value)))+\n  geom_col(position=\"dodge\")+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#EE3377\",\"#009988\",\"#CC3311\",\"#33BBEE\", \"#EE7733\"))+\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(\"[0,10)\", \"[10,20)\",\"[20,30)\", \"[30,40)\",\"[40,50]\"),\n                   labels=c(\"1-10\", \"11-20\", \"21-30\", \"31-40\", \"41-50\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,10))+\n  labs(title=\"The Ebb and Flow of the Game: Over-by-Over Runs in 10-Overs Bins\",\n       x = \"Overs\",\n       y = \"Runs Scores\",\n       fill = \"Innings\")+\n  geom_point(aes(y=runs),\n             position=position_dodge(width=0.85),\n             size=df_2015_p1$n_wickets*5, alpha=0.2)+\n  geom_text(vjust = 0, hjust = 0.64, label=df_2015_p1$n_wickets,\n            position = position_dodge(width = 0.80),\n            size=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_2015_p2a, aes(y=bowler, x=runs_scored, fill=binned_overs))+\n  geom_col()+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#EE3377\",\"#009988\",\"#CC3311\",\"#33BBEE\", \"#EE7733\"))+\n  facet_wrap(~striker)+\n  xlab(\"Runs Scored\")+\n  ylab(\"Bowler\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Runs scored by Australian Batsmen in front of New Zealand Bowlers\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_2015_p2b, aes(y=bowler, x=runs_scored, fill=binned_overs))+\n  geom_col()+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#EE3377\",\"#009988\",\"#CC3311\",\"#33BBEE\", \"#EE7733\"))+\n  facet_wrap(~striker)+\n  xlab(\"Runs Scored\")+\n  ylab(\"Bowler\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Runs scored by New Zealand Batsmen in front of Australian Bowlers\")\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn the opening innings of the match, New Zealand took to the batting crease but encountered challenges in establishing a formidable target for Australia to pursue. The initial chart reveals a slow start for New Zealand, with bars of minimal height reflecting the struggle in the early overs of the game. However, despite the challenging beginning, Ross Taylor and Grant Elliott displayed resilience, mounting a commendable effort to bring New Zealand back into contention.\nUpon closer examination of the first plot, it becomes apparent that New Zealand scored fewer runs during the powerplay overs in comparison to England, despite only losing one wicket. The singular bar in the final bin indicates that Australia efficiently chased down the target in less than 40 overs.\nTransitioning to the second innings, the chart illustrates an accelerated scoring phase in the initial 10 overs, even though Aaron Finch faced dismissal without scoring. The noteworthy contributions of David Warner and Steve Smith are clearly depicted in the second plot. Following Finch’s early departure, the responsibility then shifted to Michael Clarke, who played a pivotal role for Australia throughout the majority of the game.\n\n\n3.3.4 ICC 2019 World Cup (Men’s) Final\n\n\nCode\ndf_2019_p1 %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(innings) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=binned_overs, y=runs, fill=factor(value)))+\n  geom_col(position=\"dodge\")+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#EE3377\",\"#009988\",\"#CC3311\",\"#33BBEE\", \"#EE7733\"))+\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(\"[0,10)\", \"[10,20)\",\"[20,30)\", \"[30,40)\",\"[40,50]\"),\n                   labels=c(\"1-10\", \"11-20\", \"21-30\", \"31-40\", \"41-50\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,10))+\n  labs(title=\"The Ebb and Flow of the Game: Over-by-Over Runs in 10-Overs Bins\",\n       x = \"Overs\",\n       y = \"Runs Scores\",\n       fill = \"Innings\")+\n  geom_point(aes(y=runs),\n             position=position_dodge(width=0.85),\n             size=df_2019_p1$n_wickets*5, alpha=0.2)+\n  geom_text(vjust = 0, hjust = 0.64, label=df_2019_p1$n_wickets,\n            position = position_dodge(width = 0.80),\n            size=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_2019_p2a, aes(y=bowler, x=runs_scored, fill=binned_overs))+\n  geom_col()+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#EE3377\",\"#009988\",\"#CC3311\",\"#33BBEE\", \"#EE7733\"))+\n  facet_wrap(~striker)+\n  xlab(\"Runs Scored\")+\n  ylab(\"Bowler\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Runs scored by New Zealand Batsmen in front of England Bowlers\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_2019_p2b, aes(y=bowler, x=runs_scored, fill=binned_overs))+\n  geom_col()+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#EE3377\",\"#009988\",\"#CC3311\",\"#33BBEE\", \"#EE7733\"))+\n  facet_wrap(~striker)+\n  xlab(\"Runs Scored\")+\n  ylab(\"Bowler\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Runs scored by England Batsmen in front of New Zealand Bowlers\")\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis game stands out in its uniqueness, particularly evident in the unconventional occurrence of four innings during the 2019 World Cup Finals. As depicted in the charts, both teams managed to score an identical number of runs at the end of the standard 50 overs, leading to the implementation of a “Super Over” decision-making strategy. In this format, each team is granted the opportunity to play one over, and the team scoring the highest number of runs is declared the winner.\nRemarkably, the Super Over resulted in yet another tie, prompting an unprecedented resolution method—the team that hit the most boundaries would be declared the ultimate victor. This decision sparked considerable controversy within the cricketing world.\nWhile other insights from the chart align with patterns observed in the 2011 and 2015 Finals, a notable detail emerges: England lost six wickets in the second innings during the last 10 overs of the game. This can be attributed, in part, to the heightened stress inherent in such a high-stakes match. In an attempt to score quickly, England’s batsmen took risks that ultimately led to their dismissals. This underscores the impact of pressure on decision-making and performance, especially in crucial moments of the game.\n\n\n3.3.5 Diving down further…\nA fascinating correlation to note lies in the relationship between the runs scored during the power play (the initial 10 overs of the game) and the ultimate outcome of the match. In the world cup finals of 2011, 2015 and 2019, the team that accumulated more runs during the power play emerged victorious. The power play, characterised by the restriction of only two fielders outside the 30-yard circle, provides a favourable scenario for the batting team to target boundaries (4s and 6s). With limited fielders to prevent the ball from reaching the boundary, the batting team has ample opportunity to score during this phase.\nThis period becomes a critical juncture for teams, as a substantial accumulation of runs during the power play lays the foundation for setting a higher target for the opposition. The heightened risk-taking by batsmen during this phase often results in the loss of wickets, contributing to the dynamic nature of the game. While not an absolute rule, this trend is commonly observed in high-stakes matches where batsmen strategically aim to maximise their runs during the power play, leveraging the advantage presented by the fielding restrictions.\n\n\n3.3.6 ICC 2023 World Cup (Men’s) Final\n\n\nCode\ndf_2023_p1 %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(innings) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=binned_overs, y=runs, fill=factor(value)))+\n  geom_col(position=\"dodge\")+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#EE3377\",\"#009988\",\"#CC3311\",\"#33BBEE\", \"#EE7733\"))+\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(\"[0,10)\", \"[10,20)\",\"[20,30)\", \"[30,40)\",\"[40,50]\"),\n                   labels=c(\"1-10\", \"11-20\", \"21-30\", \"31-40\", \"41-50\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,10))+\n  labs(title=\"The Ebb and Flow of the Game: Over-by-Over Runs in 10-Overs Bins\",\n       x = \"Overs\",\n       y = \"Runs Scores\",\n       fill = \"Innings\")+\n  geom_point(aes(y=runs),\n             position=position_dodge(width=0.85),\n             size=df_2023_p1$n_wickets*5, alpha=0.2)+\n  geom_text(vjust = 0, hjust = 0.64, label=df_2023_p1$n_wickets,\n            position = position_dodge(width = 0.80),\n            size=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_2023_p2a, aes(y=bowler, x=runs_scored, fill=binned_overs))+\n  geom_col()+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#EE3377\",\"#009988\",\"#CC3311\",\"#33BBEE\", \"#EE7733\"))+\n  facet_wrap(~striker)+\n  xlab(\"Runs Scored\")+\n  ylab(\"Bowler\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Runs scored by Australian Batsmen in front of Indian Bowlers\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_2023_p2b, aes(y=bowler, x=runs_scored, fill=binned_overs))+\n  geom_col()+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#EE3377\",\"#009988\",\"#CC3311\",\"#33BBEE\", \"#EE7733\"))+\n  facet_wrap(~striker)+\n  xlab(\"Runs Scored\")+\n  ylab(\"Bowler\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Runs scored by Indian Batsmen in front of Australian Bowlers\")\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe recent cricket match that transpired on November 19 showcased a noteworthy contest between India and Australia, culminating in a victory for the latter. The initial phase of the game, as indicated by the first plot, underscored India’s pronounced dominance in the first 10 overs. During this period, India exhibited superior run-scoring prowess while minimizing wicket losses. However, the dynamics of the game shifted significantly thereafter.\nBeyond the initial 10 overs, Australia seized control and maintained their ascendancy throughout the remainder of the match. Despite the early dismissals of key players such as Warner, Smith, and Marsh, Australia remarkably avoided further setbacks, with only one wicket falling between overs 40 and 50. Travis Head emerged as the standout performer for Australia, anchoring the innings and ensuring their successful pursuit of the target.\nA notable departure from the patterns observed in other World Cup finals is evident in this match. Contrary to the historical trend, the team that scored more runs during the powerplay (overs 1-10) - in this case, India - ultimately found themselves on the losing side. This deviation adds a distinctive dimension to the narrative of the World Cup final, highlighting the unpredictable nature of cricket and the capacity for momentum shifts in the course of a match."

Notably, teams like Australia and South Africa exhibit a high likelihood of winning the game in ODIs if they successfully win the toss. On the contrary, teams like India and New Zealand seem unaffected by the toss outcome in ODIs. It is interesting to observe that, with the exception of England, these teams have won the toss and the subsequent game less frequently than when they have lost the toss but still emerged victorious.\nA surprising statistic is India’s record in Test Matches, where they have not won a game after winning the toss from 2016 till present. Conversely, England seems to have often benefited from winning the toss in Test Matches. This trend might suggest that other teams could potentially improve their outcomes by making more advantageous decisions when winning the toss.\nIn the case of T20Is, every team has won the toss and the subsequent game less frequently than when they have lost the toss but still managed to secure a victory. Given the fast-paced nature of T20 cricket, drawing concrete conclusions about this phenomenon proves challenging. Nevertheless, it remains an intriguing aspect worth exploring further."

    "text": "Batsmen Dismissal Analysis: Percentage Breakdown by Dismissal Type\n\n\nChoose a player from the dropdown menu adjacent to the plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the realm of cricket, the analysis of a batsman’s dismissals is crucial for opposing teams, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses. A strategic game plan to dismiss batsmen efficiently contributes significantly to gaining control over a match. Our interactive chart delves into the dismissal types of the world’s top 10 run-scorers, offering a visual breakdown to answer the question: “What are the strengths and weaknesses of individual cricketing titans?”\nBefore delving into the chart’s analysis, it’s essential to understand the significance of each dismissal category:\n\nBowled: Occurs when a batsman’s wicket is fairly broken by a bowler-delivered ball.\nCaught: Involves a batsman being out when a delivered ball hits the bat and is subsequently held by a fielder without touching the ground.\nCaught Behind: A specific case of being caught out, taken by the wicketkeeper or slip fielders.\nLeg Before Wicket (LBW): Involves a batsman being out if a fair ball hits any part of the body (except the hand) without first touching the bat, with a trajectory indicating it would hit the wickets.\nStumped: Occurs when a batsman, facing a fair delivery, steps out of the crease, and the wicket is broken by the wicketkeeper, often happening against spin bowlers.\nRun Out: A batsman is declared run out if they fail to get their bat past the crease before it is broken while running between the wickets.\nOthers: Encompasses dismissal types like hit-wicket or out due to obstruction.\n\nNow, understanding the relationship between each dismissal type and a batsman’s weaknesses:\n\nBowled: Indicates difficulty in covering the line of the ball or flaws in footwork, potentially related to adapting to varying pitch conditions.\nCaught: Suggests issues with shot timing or selection, reflecting an aggressive playing style or situational constraints.\nCaught Behind: Indicates trouble facing deliveries that seam and swing outward, with vulnerabilities in playing away from the body.\nLBW: Suggests challenges in covering the line of the ball and problems facing deliveries that seam and swing inward, possibly coupled with a tendency to play across the line.\nStumped: Indicates a tendency to step out to spinners, exploitable by opposition teams through flighted deliveries.\nRun Out: Reflects poor running between the wickets, exploitable by preventing boundaries and encouraging singles and doubles.\n\nDirect inferences from the plots reveal that “Caught Out” is the most common dismissal type, attributed to the aggressive nature of modern cricket. Rare dismissals like hit-wicket or obstruction form a minimal proportion in the game.\nUsing the visualization\nThe pie chart above provides a visual representation of dismissal types for each batsman, facilitating a detailed comparison. One may select the player from the dropdown menu and hover the mouse on the chart to get the proportion and the actual values of the dismissal.\n\nComparing the Cricketing Greats Rahul Dravid and Virat Kohli\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRahul Dravid\nVirat Kohli\n\n\n\n\nAfter “Caught Out,” the highest proportion is “Bowled,” indicating potential issues in covering the line of the ball or foot movement.\nAfter “Caught Out,” the highest proportion is “Caught Behind,” revealing difficulties in playing deliveries on the 4th and 5th stump and a tendency to play away from the body.\n\n\n“Run Out” follows, suggesting challenges in running between the wickets.\n“Bowled” follows, suggesting challenges against swinging or spinning inward deliveries.\n\n\nThe lowest proportion is “Stumped,” indicating Dravid’s proficiency against spin.\nNotably, Kohli has a considerably lower proportion of “Run Out,” indicating his proficiency between the wickets.\n\n\n\nSimilar insights can be gleaned for other players by selecting them from the dropdown menu."
